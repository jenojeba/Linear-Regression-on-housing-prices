# Linear Regression on Housing Prices

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and distance to employment centers. By analyzing the Boston housing dataset, we aim to understand the relationship between the different features and the median value of homes (MEDV), ultimately providing insights into the factors that influence housing prices.

## Overview

In this project, we will perform the following steps:

1. **Load Data**: Load the Boston housing dataset using `pandas`.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Define the features and the target variable.
3. **Split the Data**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Train the Linear Regression Model**: Create and train a linear regression model on the training data.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Use evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess the model's performance.
6. **Visualize the Results**: Visualize the actual vs predicted housing prices.
